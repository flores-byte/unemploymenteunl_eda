# unemploymenteunl_eda
An EDA based on World Bank's unemployment rate trends between 2000 and 2023. Narrowed down to the Europe and the Netherlands.
I have narrowed down this EDA to the European Union and the Netherlands specifically, as those regions align with my academic and professional focus. I have used Pandas for data analysis and reshaping; and Seaborn for creating line charts and heatmaps to visualize the trends effectively.

Throughout this analysis, I have observed varying unemployment patterns across EU member states. Countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, and Czech Republic maintained consistently low unemployment rates, while others like Spain and Greece exhibited significant increases following the 2008 financial crisis. Poland notably started with high unemployment (around 20%) in the early 2000s but steadily improved to below 5% by the 2020s.

The Netherlands, in particular, showed moderate fluctuations, with a peak of 7.4% in 2014 and a general decline in recent years, demonstrating strong economic recovery and resilience.

Graphs are available in the "visualizations" branch, and interpretive reports can be found in the "essays" branch. The dataset I've used is at "data" branch, and the notebook I've used is at "notebook" branch.
